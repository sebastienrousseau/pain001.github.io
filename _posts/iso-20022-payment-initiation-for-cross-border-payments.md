## Overview

Banks, corporations, and financial institutions around the globe are adopting
ISO 20022 for high-value payments systems and cross-border payments, leveraging
its power to automate and standardise payment transactions.

The **Pain001** Python Finance Library generates fully compliant and valid
**ISO 20022 Payment messages** that can integrate seamlessly into your payment
system, reducing payments creation and processing costs and improving
efficiency.

## What are ISO 20022 payment initiation messages?

**ISO 20022 payment initiation messages** are a set of XML-based messages that
are used to enable payments between financial institutions. These messages are
designed to be more efficient and secure than traditional payment messages.
They also provide more detailed information about the payment.

There are two main types of ISO 20022 Payment Initiation messages:

- **CustomerCreditTransferInitiation messages** initiate credit transfers.
- **CustomerDirectDebitInitiation messages** initiate direct debits.

Both message contain information about the payer, the payee, the amount of the
payment, and the date and time of the payment. They also contain additional
information, such as the purpose of the payment and the reference number.

A wide range of financial institutions, including banks, payment service
providers, and clearinghouses, use **ISO 20022 payment initiation messages**.

**Pain001** supports the following ISO 20022 Payment Initiation message types:

- **[Customer Credit Transfer Initiation V3 (pain.001.001.03) ‚ùØ][3]**
- **[Customer Credit Transfer Initiation V4 (pain.001.001.04) ‚ùØ][4]**
- **[Customer Credit Transfer Initiation V5 (pain.001.001.05) ‚ùØ][5]**
- **[Customer Credit Transfer Initiation V9 (pain.001.001.09) ‚ùØ][9]**

All of these are part of the ISO 20022 standard. V3 is common for SEPA Credit
Transfers, and V4 for international credit transfers outside the Single Euro
Payments Area (SEPA).

All versions carry the originator‚Äôs and beneficiary‚Äôs details, references, and
other relevant information for credit transfer processing. V9, as a newer
iteration, adds extras such as the currency and the SWIFT codes of the involved
banks, and allows for more payments in a single message.

These messages transmit credit transfer instructions from the originator to
their bank, supporting both bulk and single payment instructions. This
capability enables transmission of multiple payments in a batch or individual
payments separately.
