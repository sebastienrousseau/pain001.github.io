**Version:** 0.0.23

**Useful links:** [Installation](/installation/index.html) | [Source Repository](https://github.com/sebastienrousseau/pain001) | [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/sebastienrousseau/pain001/issues) | [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pain001/)

## What is Pain001?

**Pain001** is an open-source Python Library that you can use to create
**ISO 20022-Compliant Payment Files** directly from your **CSV** or **SQLite**
Data Files.

The Python library focuses specifically on
**Payment Initiation and Advice Messages**, commonly known as **Pain**. In a
very simplified way, a **pain.001** is a message that initiates the customer
payment.

As of today the library is designed to be compatible with the
**pain.001.001.03** and **pain.001.001.09** message types and will support more
message types in the future.

Payments usually start with a **pain.001 payment initiation message**. The
payer sends it to the payee (or the payee‚Äôs bank) via a secure network. This
network could be **SWIFT** or **SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area) network**, or
other payment networks such as **CHAPS**, **BACS**, **Faster Payments**, etc.
The message contains the payer‚Äôs and payee‚Äôs bank account details, payment
amount, and other information required to process the payment.

The **Pain001** library can reduce payment processing complexity and costs by
generating ISO 20022-compliant payment files. These files automatically remove
the need to create and validate them manually, making the payment process more
efficient and cost-effective. It will save you time and resources and minimises
the risk of errors, making sure accurate and seamless payment processing.

Use the **Pain001** library to simplify, accelerate and automate your payment
processing.

## System requirements

The only prerequisite for installing **Pain001** is Python itself. **Pain001**
works with macOS, Linux and Windows and requires Python 3.9.0 and above.
