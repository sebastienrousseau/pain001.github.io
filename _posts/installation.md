## Get started

It takes just a few seconds to get up and running with **Pain001**. If you use
pip, open your terminal and run the following command:

```sh
pip install pain001
```

Add the -U switch to update to the current version, if `pain001` is already
installed. For example:

```sh
pip install -U pain001
```

If you do not have pip installed, you can download and install it from this
page: <https://pypi.org/project/pip/>. Alternatively, you can use
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) to install pip.

## How do I use Pain001?

Itâ€™s easy to use **Pain001** to generate a payment initiation message from a
CSV or SQLite Data file. After installation, you can run **Pain001** directly
from the command line.

Simply call the main module pain001 with the paths of your:

- **XML template file** containing the various parameters you want to pass from
  your Data file,
- **XSD schema file** to validate the generated XML file, and
- **Data file (CSV or SQLite)** containing the payment instructions that you
  want to submit.

Hereâ€™s how you would do that:

```sh
python3 -m pain001 \
    <xml_message_type> \
    <xml_template_file_path> \
    <xsd_schema_file_path> \
    <data_file_path>
```

### Arguments

When running **Pain001**, you will need to specify four arguments:

- An `xml_message_type`: This is the type of XML message you want to generate.

  The currently supported types are:
  - pain.001.001.03
  - pain.001.001.04
  - pain.001.001.09
- An `xml_template_file_path`: This is the path to the XML template file you
  are using that contains variables that will be replaced by the values in your
  Data file.
- An `xsd_schema_file_path`: This is the path to the XSD schema file you are
  using to validate the generated XML file.
- A `data_file_path`: This is the path to the CSV or SQLite Data file you want
  to convert to XML format.

## Examples

The following examples demonstrate how to use **Pain001** to generate a payment
initiation message from a CSV file and a SQLite Data file.

### Using a CSV Data File as the source

```sh
python3 -m pain001 \
    pain.001.001.03 \
    /path/to/your/template.xml \
    /path/to/your/pain.001.001.03.xsd \
    /path/to/your/template.csv
```

### Using a SQLite Data File as the source

```sh
python3 -m pain001 \
    pain.001.001.03 \
    /path/to/your/template.xml \
    /path/to/your/pain.001.001.03.xsd \
    /path/to/your/template.db
```

### Using the Source code

You can clone the source code and run the example code in your
terminal/command-line. To check out the source code, clone the repository from
GitHub:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/sebastienrousseau/pain001.git
```

  Then, navigate to the `pain001` directory and run the following command:

  ```sh
  python3 -m pain001 \
      pain.001.001.03 \
      templates/pain.001.001.03/template.xml \
      templates/pain.001.001.03/pain.001.001.03.xsd \
      templates/pain.001.001.03/template.csv
  ```

This will generate a payment initiation message from the sample CSV Data file.

You can do the same with the sample SQLite Data file:

```sh
python3 -m pain001 \
    pain.001.001.03 \
    templates/pain.001.001.03/template.xml \
    templates/pain.001.001.03/pain.001.001.03.xsd \
    templates/pain.001.001.03/template.db
```

> **Note:** The XML file that **Pain001** generates will automatically be
validated against the XSD template file before the new XML file is saved. If
the validation fails, **Pain001** will stop running and display an error
message in your terminal.

### Embedded in an Application

To embed **Pain001** in a new or existing application, import the main function
and use it in your code.

Here's an example:

```python
from pain001 import main

if __name__ == '__main__':
  xml_message_type = 'pain.001.001.03'
  xml_template_file_path = 'template.xml'
  xsd_schema_file_path = 'schema.xsd'
  data_file_path = 'data.csv'
  main(
    xml_message_type,
    xml_template_file_path,
    xsd_schema_file_path,
    data_file_path
  )
```

### Validation

To validate the generated XML file against a given xsd schema, use the
following method:

```python
from pain001.core import validate_xml_against_xsd

xml_message_type = 'pain.001.001.03'
xml_file = 'generated.xml'
xsd_file = 'schema.xsd'

is_valid = validate_xml_against_xsd(
  xml_message_type,
  xml_file,
  xsd_file
)
print(f"XML validation result: {is_valid}")
```
